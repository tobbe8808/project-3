# **Tobbes TictacToe**

This Tictactoe is a game that you run in the Code institutes mock terminal in Heroku.

[Here is the live version of the Tictactoe game](https://tictactoetobbe.herokuapp.com/)

# **How to play**

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, the computer in this case is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

# **Features/Testing**

## Invalid inputs

- While playing the game if you use any input that isn't 1-9 game asks for input again.
- No letters are allowed or numbers below 1 or over 9 and already picked numbers.
- If you use a wrong input, it will just ask you forever until you put a valid one in the terminal.

## Code tested

- The code is tested for no errors found in the gitpod terminal and on Heroku manually.
- Tested all win conditions, tested tie, tested all different characters to see if it would crash instead of asking for input again.
- Tested code in PEP8 1 error "w292 no newline at end of file" But that is a known error and accepted.
- Did a lot of code testing to be validated with pep8 and to fix those errors that occurred.

# Bugs

I had a lot of problems with "Line too long (82 &gt; 79 characters) (E501)" on the entire checkForWinner section of the code.<br>
if gameBoard[0][0] == "X" and gameBoard[0][1] == "X" and gameBoard[0][2] == "X":<br>
        print(player, "winner")<br>
        return "X"<br>

But that code was too long and i tried to write it with a backslash.<br>
if gameBoard[0][0] == "X" and gameBoard[0][1] == \<br>
"X" and gameBoard[0][2] == "X"  :<br>
        print(player, "winner")<br>
        return "X"<br>

Also tried with parentheses.<br>
if (gameBoard[0][0] == "X" and gameBoard[0][1] == "X"<br>
and gameBoard[0][2] == "X"):<br>

The ways I tried didn't work and crashed my code and when swapping gameboard to board the characters got less and had no error.<br>
I could fix it with as well # noqa: E501 at the end of the codeline.<br>
But if I used that it would be to many lines and it wouldn't look good so just better to change gameboard to game.<br>

## Unsolved bugs

None that I came across.<br>

# Strategy

### User needs

- Rules Explained before the game starts.

# Future of the game

- Add so you can play player vs player and not only vs computer.<br>
- Add so the game keeps score if you play for a longer sessions how many times each has won.<br>
- Make computer smarter so the game gets harder in different levels you can choose.<br>

# Technologies i used

Code institute python template.<br>
Github and Gitpod - coded the project in gitpod and uploaded it to github.<br>
Heroku - deployed the game to run.<br>
PEP8<br>

## Import

I used import random to set up so the computer could choose a random number.

# Deployment

1. Signed up to Heroku.
2. Click create new app.
3. I choose a name and region Europe.
4. Click create app button.
5. Go to settings and choose build packs.
6. Then i choose python and node.js pack checking so python is first then node.js.
7. Go to deploy section.
8. choose github and set it up to be able to be used by Heroku.
9. find my github repository i wanna submit in the search function.
10. choose main branch and deploy using the manual metod.
11. I choose Manual deployment cause i wanna deploy it Manualy you can also choose Automatic and it will update it on every git push.
